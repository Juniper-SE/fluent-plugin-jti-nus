RHEL8 Installation Addendum

When installing on RHEL8 the following changes need to occur when working through the installation guide

  1) Instead of
        sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
     Replace with
        sudo dnf group install "Development Tools"

  2) Instead of
        curl -fsSL https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-jammy-fluent-package5-lts.sh | sh
     Replace with
        curl -fsSL https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-redhat-fluent-package5-lts.sh | sh

  3) Updating local package index, instead of
        sudo apt update
     Replace with
        sudo dnf update

  4) For package installs, instead of
        sudo apt-get
     use
        sudo dnf

Also by default RHEL8 may already have a few of the basic packages (Openssh-*, netcat) installed.
You may only need to verify that they are installed instead of installing them.
