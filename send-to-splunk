#
# to use this plugin configuration you need to install the splunk-hec plugin
#   on the fluentd server
#     > sudo fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-splunk-hec
#
# change all of the following to match your environment
#
#   _IP-address-of-the-splunk-server_    (Note: it can be localhost)
#   _port-it-is-listening-on_             (Note: splunk uses 8088 by default)
#   _replace-all-of-this-with-your-HEC_token_
#
# NOTE:
#   https is supported by default. This configuration is using http.
#     To use http, you also need to make changes on the Splunk server
#     to the file /opt/splunk/etc/apps/splunk_httpinput/default/inputs.conf
#       Modify these settings under [http] to use http
#         disabled=0
#         enableSSL=0
#
# NOTE:
#   data_type metric tells Splunk to treat event messages as if they are metric
#     messages. I have noticed that occasionally Splunk will complain about 
#     a bad format.
